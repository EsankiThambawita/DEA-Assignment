Development of an E-Commerce Application using Java Technologies

# Notice: Change in Repository Usage

Dear Team,

We would like to inform you of a recent development regarding the repository used for our project. On April 10th, one of our team members discovered that their computer had been infected with a virus. Subsequently, files were inadvertently pushed to the repository after the infection was detected.

Despite efforts to mitigate the risk by scanning both the local and online repositories and attempting to revert commits, we have concluded that the integrity of the repository may have been compromised. Given the critical nature of our project, we cannot afford to take any risks.

Therefore, we have made the decision to discontinue the use of this repository for our project going forward. We have transitioned to a new repository for the backend implementation and subsequent phases of the project.

We apologize for any inconvenience this may cause, but the security and stability of our project are of utmost importance. If you have any questions or concerns, please feel free to reach out.

Thank you for your understanding and cooperation.

Sincerely,
Esanki Thambawita.
